1.1 Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers and then find out
the smallest and largest number stored in it. n is the user input.
1.2 Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers, where the array
must contains some duplicates. Do the following:
a) Find out the total number of duplicate elements.
b) Find out the most repeating element in the array.
1.3 Write a program to rearrange the elements of an array of n integers such that all even
numbers are followed by all odd numbers. How many different ways you can solve this
problem. Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.
1.4 Write a program that takes three variable (a, b, c) as separate parameters and rotates the
values stored so that value a goes to be, b, b to c and c to a by using SWAP(x,y)
function that swaps/exchanges the numbers x & y.
1.5 Let A be n*n square matrix array. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for
the following:
a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A
b) Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.
c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal.
d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.
